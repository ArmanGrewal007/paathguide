## 1. Research & Setup  
- âœ… **Audio to text transcriber** &rarr; openai-whisper turbo model does the work. Tried [Conformer-CTC-BPE-Large.nemo](https://github.com/Open-Speech-EkStep/vakyansh-models#:~:text=punjabi_large_ssl_500) as well but it didn't work as expected. Still, need to get the `wer`, for that I need SGGS local DB.
